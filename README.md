Updates 2/15/21: Fixed image-click problem, added border select with settimeouts, used flex for images in container.

Next: Make it so 'Displayed Results' text doesn't appear until after border animations. Do Game Over border colors on finale screen.

Updates 2/16/21: Fixed margin problem for narrow screen size on displayed results. Also made sure borders are gone when gameOver function runs.
